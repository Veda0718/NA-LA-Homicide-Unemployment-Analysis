# Interactive Exploration of Homicide and Unemployment Rates in North and Latin America
This project delves into the complex relationship between homicide and unemployment rates across North and Latin America, utilizing interactive visualizations built on an HTML page. By leveraging rich datasets and carefully chosen visual attributes, we unveil hidden trends, compare and contrast regional patterns, and offer a nuanced understanding of these interconnected socio-economic indicators.

## Key Features
 - **Geospatial Map:** Visualize homicide rates across countries with color encoding for intensity variations. Explore trends by hovering over specific regions.
 - **Hover Trend Chart:** See detailed trends for individual countries upon hovering in the geospatial map.
 - **Trend Chart:** Analyze temporal trends of homicide and unemployment rates for your chosen country.
 - **Scatter Plot:** Explore the correlation between unemployment and homicide rates for each country through interactive plotting.
 - **Bar and Column Charts:** Focus on individual countries and compare homicide and unemployment rates across years.

## Our Goals
 - **Uncover hidden patterns:** Leverage visualizations to reveal trends and relationships masked within raw data.
 - **Compare regional patterns:** Examine variations in homicide and unemployment rates across North and Latin America.
 - **Foster deeper understanding:** Provide insights into the interplay between these social and economic indicators.

## Obstacles and Limitations
 - **Data quality:** We acknowledge the potential impact of incomplete or inaccurate data on the accuracy of our insights.
 - **Generalization:** Our visualizations offer a high-level overview but may not capture specific regional nuances.

## Future Work
 - **Global scaling:** Expand the analysis to include data from other regions and countries for a broader perspective.
 - **Enhanced interactivity:** Implement additional features for user customization and deeper exploration.
 - **Data enrichment:** Incorporate more socio-economic indicators for a richer understanding of the data.
 - **Performance optimization:** Address scaling concerns for larger datasets and improved user experience.

## Conclusion
This project utilizes interactive visualizations to shed light on the complex relationship between homicide and unemployment rates. While acknowledging limitations, we believe our work provides valuable insights and lays the foundation for further exploration in this domain. We invite you to interact with the visualizations and discover the captivating trends and patterns hidden within the data.
